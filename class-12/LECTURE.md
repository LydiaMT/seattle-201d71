# Class 12: Third Party Libraries and Chart JS

## Code Review

- What went well?
  - Using typed-demo was helpful.
  - Going through the feature tasks before lab time was helpful.
- What was really hard?
  - Using .includes for matching product objects to img elements
  - Difficult to ensure that new images a rendered after each click.
  - Today was a big blob of features and requirements.
  - Removing event listener.
  - Dead end trying to implement new things
    - src attribute.
    - leaving it empty and populate it with the dom.
    - .includes method.
  - Using the .includes method to match a substring will look for exact substrings.
  - Sorting a array
    - we're not going dive into this too much.
